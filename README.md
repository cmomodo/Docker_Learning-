# Docker_Learning-

we will explore what we have beeen learning about Docker.

This will also contain all the projects we create in our journey.

The first step was to learn about the basics.

Next we will apply our knowledge in creating a basic flask web app.

we will then containerise it and test it out.

## BACKEND 
we will then go into docker networking.

This means we will be using multiple containers to communicate with one another.
